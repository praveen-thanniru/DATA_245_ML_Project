# Mental Health prediction using QEML is a project done as a part of DATA245.
### Mental disorders are more prevalent than heart diseases and diabetes. But there is very little importance given to this issue. With the advancements in AI, this could be an area that will benefit people to create awareness about their mental health. Combining the predictive ability of machine learning with knowledge of which factors could possibly affect mental well-being, a prediction could be made. Though a number of prior researches were made in this field, due to the dimensional constraints very few features were considered for prediction. This reduction in features can affect the accuracy of predictions which will be addressed in this project. The key is to make predictions in a higher dimensional feature space and analyze how efficient and accurate they are. Quantum enhanced Machine learning algorithms are employed to quantitatively estimate mental health based on a number of factors like age, sex, working condition, job, coworkers, etc. A mental health dataset with 27 features is used and modeled with QSVM ( Quantum Support Vector Machine). Qiskit, an open-source SDK package in python is used for working with these algorithms. An assessment of the prediction accuracy and precision is made to gauge the performance of QML models chosen for this problem.
